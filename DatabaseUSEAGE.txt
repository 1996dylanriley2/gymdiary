The database in gymdiary is supposed to be used as follows:
muscles are created/added
exercises are created/added.

workouts are then planned. a exercisestats is created with a null workoutId. 
This will be added when the exercises is being done. Note only required reps and sets are filled in. Not actual.


workouts are then done in the gym. As each exercise is completed a exercisetats object gets updated withh the
 relivant info such as sets/reps achieved vs actual ect... also datetime is then added.
a copy of the workout is saved with references to the exercise stats.

if i want to delete a exerciseStat i first have to  the value of it to null in Workout table, then delete.
